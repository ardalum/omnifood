This repository contains the project work for the Omnifood Landing Page, which was created as part of the Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann. The project was completed following Jonas's tutorial, resulting in a stunning and responsive landing page for a fictional food delivery service called Omnifood.

## Project Overview

The Omnifood Landing Page project is a practical implementation of HTML5 and CSS3 concepts taught in the Udemy course. The aim of this project is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page for a food delivery service. The page is designed to showcase the services offered by Omnifood and encourage visitors to sign up for the service.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The landing page is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that it looks great and functions seamlessly on devices of all sizes, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- Modern UI/UX: The design of the page follows modern trends in web design, with attention to typography, color schemes, and layout. This creates an engaging user experience and encourages user interaction.

- Smooth Scrolling: The page features smooth scrolling navigation that takes users to different sections of the page with elegant animations.

- Interactive Elements: Interactive features, such as the navigation menu, hover effects on food items, and subscription form, enhance user engagement and create a dynamic experience.
